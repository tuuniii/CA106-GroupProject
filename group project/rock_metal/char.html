                <h1>Characteristics</h1>
                <p class="rock-p">Rock music is highly eclectic with varying characteristics across its many subgenres, but there are a few consistent traits.</p>

                <h2>Energy</h2>
                <p class="rock-p">
                    Compared to earlier forms of popular music like big band and show-tune standards, rock music offers surging, propulsive energy. As a result, early rock 'n' roll appealed heavily to teenagers.

                <h2>Propulsive rhythms</h2>
                <p class="rock-p">Most rock music is written in the 4/4 time signature, although some rock classics have been penned in triple meter like 3/4 and 12/8. Rock tempos vary immensely, but many rockers favor a range of 100 to 140 beats per minute.</p>

                <h2>Electric instruments and drum kits</h2>
                <p class="rock-p">
                    Most rock bands are anchored around an electric guitar, electric bass, and drum kit. Some bands have keyboard players, and many rock guitarists double on acoustic guitar, but the core of the band tends to be electric (and often quite loud). Virtuoso rock musicians include guitarist Jimi Hendrix, drummer Neal Peart, bassist John Entwistle, and keyboardist Keith Emerson.

                <h2>A wide array of lyrical subjects</h2>
                <p class="rock-p">
                    Compared to the blues, country, folk, big band, and swing music that preceded it, rock music allows for a vast range of lyrical content. Some rockers—including Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Morrissey, and Jeff Tweedy—have written lyrics considered to be in league with fine poetry.
