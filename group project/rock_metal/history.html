                <p class="rock-p">
                    The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the <span>United States</span> during the late <span>1940s</span> and early <span>1950s</span>, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various black musical genres of the time, including <span>rhythm and blues</span> and <span>gospel music</span>, with <span>country</span> and <span>western</span>.
                   <br><br> Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct <span>subgenres</span>, including <span>rockabilly</span>, combining rock and roll with "hillbilly" country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as <span>Elvis Presley</span>. 
                   <br>
                   <br> Hispanic and Latino American movements in rock and roll, which would eventually lead to the success of <span>Latin rock</span> and <span>Chicano rock</span> within the US, began to rise in the Southwest.

                <p class="rock-p">
                    Rock musicians in the <span>mid-1960s</span> began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with <span>the Beatles</span> at the forefront of this development.
                   <br><br> <span>Metallica's</span> single <span>“Enter Sandman”</span> set radio and MTV ablaze in July 1991.<br><br>
                    <span>Nirvana's “Smells Like Teen Spirit”</span> is often listed as the most important song of the 1990s.<br><br>
                    <span>Perry Farrell</span> of <span>Jane's Addiction</span> created <span>Lollapalooza</span>, a roving extravaganza of sound that introduced the masses to underground genres.

                <p class="rock-p">
                    From the 1990s, <span>alternative rock </span> began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of <span>Britpop</span>, and <span>indie rock</span>. <br><br>
                    Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including <span>electronic rock</span>, and conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the <span>garage rock post-punk techno-pop</span> revivals in the 2000s.<br><br>
                    This period was a time of great experimentation and innovation, leading to the diverse range of rock sub-genres we see today.

                    Since the 2010s, rock has <span>lost</span> its position as the pre-eminent popular music genre in world culture, but remains commercially successful. <br><br>
                    The increased influence of <span>hip-hop</span> and <span>electronic dance music</span> can be seen in rock music, notably in the <span>techno-pop scene</span> of the early 2010s and the <span>pop-punk-hip-hop</span> revival of the 2020s. <br><br>
